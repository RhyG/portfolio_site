# Portfolio site

The purpose of this website is as an online portfolio that potential employers and the generally curious can have a look at. Visitors will be able to see some of my skills, things I have worked on and the kind of person I am overall.

# Development and design process
<a id="dev"></a> 

The development process was broken into three stages:

1. Design phase
    * Create a wireframe of the site
    * Moodboard and decide on colour and aesthetic
    * Mockup designs in Sketch

2. Development phase
    * Complete HTML for the website
    * Apply styling
    * Test throughout build

3. Deployment
    * Deploy website
    * Monitor for any issues that may arise

### Design phase

The design phase was completed during the first day of the assignment. It started with getting inspiration from other developers and their portfolio sites, and it was during this phase that I got a good idea of what I like and don't like in a portfolio site. A lot of the sites I came across while looking for inspiration were immense, beautiful and impossibly creative adventures that a clearly talented person put a lot of effort into, and so often I barely saw half their site because there was no simple navigation, or it hijacked my scrolling and make it so tedious to get from element to element.

I knew I wanted to create a simple, minimal website with bright but subtle colours and clean lines. I also wanted to avoid using things I didn't know, such as javascript, as the concept of authenticity was important to me in the design. I wanted users to get an accurate idea of my abilities, and I didn't want to implement anything I wasn't able to explain, update or maintain.

Here are some examples of websites I took inspiration (and 'borrowed' styling) from.

Once I knew the layout I wanted it was time to start wireframing. As my design was simple and I didn't plan to put too much content on the site, this was fairly straightforward.

Once the wireframe was complete it was onto the design. For this project I used Sketch, a popular Mac program used to create software designs. I started by laying out the wireframe on the artboard, and starting asseumbling the elements and applying the styling. It was during this phase I finalised the colour palette, I used to the site [Coolors](http://coolors.co/) to help decide on a palette, and the site [Color.review](https://color.review/) to determine accessibility for the colours used. I layed out the desktop and mobile designs.

I only designed for desktop and mobile as I believed the design wouldn't change from desktop to tablet, simply scale, and it wouldn't be until mobile that the layout would change.

Finally it was time to actually build the site. 

# Considerations
<a id="considerations"></a> 

### Accessibility

Accessibility was one of my primary considerations when developing the site. Being a static HTML/CSS site achieving a high accessibility score wasn't too hard as long as my colour contrasts were high enough and my HTML was semantic.

I used the site [Color.review](https://color.review/) to choose my colours, and went with a dark text color on light colours. My highlight colour (#07889b) is only AA but being that it is scarcely used I thought that was acceptable. All other text is an almost-black that scores AAA across the board.

### Performance

Performance was also important to me, as a fast site says a lot to the user about the skill of the developer. [Research has also shown](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/) that users will leave a site if it takes over three seconds to load, which is not much time at all. As a result I was sure to keep images to a minimum, and optimised any I did have to load as quick as possible.

### SEO

Search engine optimisation was the final major consideration I made while developing the site. The importance of SEO is self-evident, especially in an industry as saturated as web development with people competing for the eyes of the user. Fortunately being a static HTML/CSS website it was simple enough to use good semantic code and give everything appropriate values and alt tags. This means that when I am ready to deploy the site properly it should rank well.

### Audits

Using the Google Chrome audits tool I was able to audit the site in these three areas.

As can be seen in the image the site has perfect scores across those three key areas, and a 93 in best practices which tests that the site is up to modern web development standards.

These scores show that I have achieved what I set out to do while developing the site.

# Target audience
<a id="audience"></a>

The target audience for this site is primarily potential employers. The goal of the website is for them to be able to get a good idea of my skills, abilities, style of work and overall personality just by browsing the site.

Other potential users include co-workers, recruiters and anyone who wants to get to know me.
