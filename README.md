# Portfolio site

The purpose of this portfolio site is to serve as a primer on who I am and what I do. It allows prospective employers, contacts and generally curious people to get to know me.

# Considerations

### Accessibility

Accessibility was one of my primary considerations when developing the site. Being a static HTML/CSS site achieving a high accessibility score wasn't too hard as long as my colour contrasts were high enough and my HTML was semantic.

I used the site [Color.review](https://color.review/) to choose my colours, and went with a dark text color on light colours. My highlight colour (#07889b) is only AA but being that it is scarcely used I thought that was acceptable. All other text is an almost-black that scores AAA across the board.

### Performance

Performance was also important to me, as a fast site says a lot to the user about the skill of the developer. [Research has also shown](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/) that users will leave a site if it takes over three seconds to load, which is not much time at all. As a result I was sure to keep images to a minimum, and optimised any I did have to load as quick as possible.

### SEO

Search engine optimisation was the final major consideration I made while developing the site. The importance of SEO is self-evident, especially in an industry as saturated as web development with people competing for the eyes of the user. Fortunately being a static HTML/CSS website it was simple enough to use good semantic code and give everything appropriate values and alt tags. This means that when I am ready to deploy the site properly it should rank well.

### Audits

Using the Google Chrome audits tool I was able to audit the site in these three areas.
